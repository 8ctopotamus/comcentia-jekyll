  <p>When you want to enhance the efficiency and productivity of a business process within your enterprise, Comcentia’s Application Development specialists can design an elegant, intuitive software solution that streamlines the process and tracks performance. Even if your current software supports part, but not all, of the process, Comcentia can analyze its code and often develop a module that integrates with the existing application to provide the new functionality and output you seek.</p>

  <p>With a track record for delivering programs both on time and on budget, Comcentia Application Development provides solutions for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>e-Business and e-Commerce (B2B, B2C, e-Banking, etc.)</li>
    <li>Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</li>
    <li>Supply Chain Management</li>
    <li>Enterprise Portal and Intranet Applications</li>
    <li>Enhancement, upgrade, or re-write of legacy system using modern software architecture</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Our base solution has most common services already implemented, such as Data Access Layer (DAL) and Reports.</p>

  <p>In most cases, Comcentia can develop your new software as a web-enabled application, hosted securely in the cloud. This not only saves space on company servers, but also eliminates the hassle of in-house maintenance and updates.</p>

  <p>Whether you need new functionality to support a team, a department, your supply chain, or the overall organization, ask us about custom application development.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re simply outgrowing an existing tangle of disparate and sometimes redundant systems, or you need to combine resources due to an organizational merger; Comcentia can analyze your legacy systems and databases and design an elegant solution that integrates all systems and aligns them with your organizational goals, while providing a consistent interface across all functions.</p>

  <p>Our team will work closely with you to align your existing system with your internal procedures. We conduct an analysis of your current system and the way you do business, and then put together a report offering mulitple IT strategies that reduce redundancy and cut cost.</p>

  <p>We would then work with you to implement your chosen strategy.</p>

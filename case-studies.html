                      <p>Faced with the sudden loss of a vendor responsible for maintaining their online system for managing and tracking pre-trial case activities, The Milwaukee County Court System turned to Comcentia. The Comcentia team immediately immersed itself in the project, quickly ramping up its knowledge of the system’s functionality and the programming behind it.</p>

                      <p>In the process, Comcentia not only supported the system to keep it in working order, but also added advanced security for the Court’s sensitive data, as well as new functionality for easier, more robust reporting and smoother day-to-day operations.</p>

                      <p>The engagement continues today with bug fixes as necessary and further enhancements, all managed through a simple workflow reporting system that logs, assigns and tracks Comcentia’s progress toward meeting requests by the system’s users and in-house administrator.</p>

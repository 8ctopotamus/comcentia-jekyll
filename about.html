      <h2>Comcentia History</h2>
      <p class="lead">The fittest survive by adapting. Witness Comcentia.</p>

      <p>Comcentia was founded in Milwaukee in 2008 and, with an eye toward serving international clients, soon opened an office in Nigeria to take advantage of longstanding business, staffing and governmental connections to company co-founder, Dele Ojelabi. But as international markets weakened, the founders made a strategic decision to close the international division and focus on the U.S. domestic marketplace.</p>

      <p>Since then, the company has evolved and earned a reputation as an agile, price-competitive provider of custom software designed to streamline organizational processes and workflow. With a stable team of talented, experienced, local programmers, the company today is thriving by serving corporate, governmental and non-profit clients from its offices in suburban Milwaukee."</p>

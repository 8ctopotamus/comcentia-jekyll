    <p>Unlike other IT providers who outsource programming to overseas sub-contractors, Comcentia’s staff technologists are all cross-trained and local to the Chicago-Milwaukee corridor. Plus they operate under a flat management structure, which fosters direct communication among any given project’s programming team, as well as an unusual sense of accountability and commitment to meeting your requirements.</p>

    <h3>Executive Leadership</h3>
    <p>Comcentia has benefited from a steady and consistent management team comprised of engineering and business professionals who have worked successfully with large, small, and government clients in key information technology sales, delivery, and operations management positions for large national and international corporations and consulting firms as well as for smaller privately held consulting companies.</p>
    <p>Our leadership team has over 18 years of professional leadership and software implementation experience including strategic leadership and software design, development, testing, and implementation. Our team includes a project management professional certified by the Project Management Institute (PMI) who has earned a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), Master of Science in Management Information Systems, Master of Business Administration (International Finance), and Bachelor of Science in Finance.</p>
